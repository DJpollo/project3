starting with the insert method going to use globalprotect linux server for hexdump method that is only available in linux. created the header method first and from here i can add my b tree entities.
2:35pm
created b tree node and from here i shoud be able to make my arrays and make sure these are available in 512 byte form.
2:50pm this session i completed my node method class going to implement this and finish my insert method

having hard time coding in linux server so im going back to to visual studio code and try and finish here but without being able to see my hexdump.

7:14pm
having hard time understanding how a btree functions and how the insert method works. so gfg b tree explination has helped.

going to try and finish my b tree implmentation by making my insert method.
2:21pm
i believ i managed to make my insert method but no real way to tell wiithout hexdump. going to move back to linux system to see the output of my idx file.
2:40pm im getting output but not sure if its correct

went back to visual studio since my hexdump isnt helping.cretaed header methods to make and update my header using my byte form node. but need to be able to read this for my print method.

defenetaly not going to be able to finish this project in time but its my fault for starting late.i created my node to byte form but completly forgot i need to be able to read this form to print my tree out. going to work on this.
1:25pm sucesfully created my read byte method so creating my print method should be easy.
2:20pm
putting everything together so i should have makor of my projcet done but still look very rough.
3:09pm 
created create,print,insert cases in my main and believe they are working correctly. going to work on search method and load csv.search method should be easier to make since i just have to traverse thorugh my tree and get the keys and values.csv might be tougher since a file needs to be made and read.
4:37pm
completed my search case and added most of it inside the case itself and my csv case is also somewhat completed but code started crashing.
5:34pm
found out i was calling it wrong in the terminal so it wasnt reading it correctly.going to finish the rest of the project tommorow and take the late penalty
5/12/2025
putting the finsihing touches and comment to explain my code. i wasnt able to make the extract method but other than that i should have everything else. and just realized i havent been loading into github but other than that everything else is good.
